# FileEditor-Java-
This is a very useful Java class that I made to streamline the File I/O process for my projects.  
I found it really annoying to have to constantly check the Java API for file operations since I used it sporatically. It also required a lot more in-depth work for simple operations than I liked. I decided to streamline this process by making this custom class do all the hard work for me so I could focus on the even harder projects I was working on. Not File I/O.

It is capable of:
1. Creating new files
2. Checking if files exist
3. Listing the files in a directory
4. Copy and pasting a file at a new path
5. Saving images
6. Writing to text files
7. Appending text files
8. Reading the whole text file at once
9. Writing to UTF-8 Binary files
10. Reading UTF-8 Binary Files
11. Reading UTF-8 Binary Files line by line
